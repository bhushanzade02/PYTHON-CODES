** SOFTMAX REGRESSION **

- Softmax regression, also known as multinomial logistic regression, 
  It is a classification algorithm used when the target variable has more than two categories. 

- It extends logistic regression by applying the softmax function to the linear outputs (logits), 
  converting them into probabilities that sum to one across classes. 

- The model is trained by minimizing the cross-entropy loss using gradient descent. During training, 
  the weights are updated iteratively to maximize the probability of the correct class for each input.


* while implementing softmax regression challenges i faced :

1.Ensuring numerical stability in the softmax function, 
  which i resolved by subtracting the maximum logit
  before exponentiation.

2.Another issue was debugging shape mismatches during
  matrix multiplication.
